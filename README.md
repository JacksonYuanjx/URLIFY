- to experiment with the potential of image recognition while playing around with Google Vision APIs
- was honestly tired of typing long URLs :)

# Tech Stack
- React Native, Google Vision's OCR API, Expo Development Environment

# Challenges/Cool things I've learned!
- creating a React Native app while testing and deploying on Expo
- using Google Vision's API and parsing the response to retrieve the desired values
- learning the structure and fundamentals of how React Native works was difficult

# Testing with the Code
- inside /config/environment.js, substitute 'GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY' with your Vision API key
- make sure to have installed: react-native, react-native-camera, react-native-easy-grid, expo/vector-icons, expo
